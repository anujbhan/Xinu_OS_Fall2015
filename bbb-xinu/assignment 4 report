Functionality
The solution exhibits an implementation of future and it has made used of following functions,
•	Future_prods -> used to produce value
•	Future_cons -> used to consume value
•	Future_set -> A system call which is used to set value in future
•	Future_get-> A system call which is used to get value from future
•	Future_alloc-> allocate memory to future
•	Future_free -> release memory used by future

We have also used the send and receive system calls for IPC between prodcons command and its child processes. Along with changes in make file to include apps folder.
